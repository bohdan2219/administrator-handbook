# Before You Install

Before installing WordPress, you need to check that your web hosting provider fulfills the necessary software and conditions. Also, you must have access to the server and some tools.

# Requirements on the server side

* PHP 7.4 or greater
* MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB 10.3 or greater

For a list of detail requirements on your web host, refer the [official requirement page](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/) and the [Server Environment page](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/).

# Requirements on local

* Login Account (user id and password) to the server via FTP or shell
* Text Editor
* FTP
* Your web browser of choice

You will need to know how to use a text editor to edit the main configuration file. If you are a Windows user, Notepad will do. If youâ€™re an OS X user you can use TextEdit. Later, you will likely want to edit your Template Files (see [Templates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Templates) for some references). You can do this through the WordPress [Administration Screens](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/), but using a good text editor is highly recommended. For more information on this, see [Editing files](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/editing-files/).



You will need to be able to use an FTP program to [upload](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/using-filezilla/) files and [set file permissions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/changing-file-permissions/) (optional). You could choose [FileZilla](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/using-filezilla/) for this task.

Now you are all set to go on to [Installation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/how-to-install-wordpress/).
