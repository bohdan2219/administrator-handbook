# Debugging WordPress

Debugging means identifying and eliminating errors or problems in your code. The last step in debugging is to test the correctness of the code and make sure that the problem doesn't happen again.

This is mostly done by developers using debugging tools and is routine in the software development stage.

The debugging process can be done using strategies like unit tests, code review, and pair programming.

So before the code or software is released to users, developers will try to find any problems, then isolate and fix them.

Sometimes fixing the code can be a real hassle, as it can take longer than writing the code itself.
